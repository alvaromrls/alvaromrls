IN PROGRESS!!
# WHO I AM ?
My name is Álvaro Morales. I was born in Alcalá de Guadaíra (Seville, Spain), and since I was a child, I showed a talent for logic and mathematics. I am a Chess Hooligan who also play videogames sometimes. As you can deduce, I speak English and Spanish. Futhermore, I'm learning French.

I also declare myself as a  ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)  fan and the tasty food is my passion.

# WHICH IS MY WORK EXPERIENCE?
## UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLE

During two years (Jul 2019 - Jun 2021) I have been working as a Software / Electronics Engineer at University of Seville's electronic department (GIE). The Electronic Engineering Group has received the mention of Group of Excellence, with the highest score, in the two calls for proposals to date (2003-2012). This research group, based in the Department of Electronic Engineering of the School of Engineering of Seville, brings together more than 30
researchers from the Electronic Technology Area, 16 of whom hold PhDs, around various lines of research.

### HUMS
A [HUMS](https://www.omgwiki.org/ddsf/doku.php?id=ddsf:public:guidebook:03_user:07_gva) is a Health and Usage Monitoring Sistem, a software which takes care of a Tank (like Iron Man's Jarvis). It follows GVA (UK) or NGVA (NATO) standards in order to create plug and play systems. During my stay in GIE, this project took most of my time and my headaches. We developed a HUMS system for GDELS-Santa Barbara which was included in a tank for the Czech Republic's army.

More info about the project [here](https://www.infodefensa.com/texto-diario/mostrar/3166079/gdels-sbs-presenta-herramienta-predictiva-mantenimiento-vehiculos-basado-condicion) (spanish).

I developed the following tasks:
- Requirements based software design.
- Learn (by my self) about DDS systems (from RTI) and how to implement it on C++ and Java.
- Design and develop a database model and API rest service with Django for saving all the data from different vehicle's subsystems.
- Prepare slides and demos for our customers (even in English).
- Integration with our client's subsystems, detecting all possible mistakes and solving them in case they exist.
- Design other subsystems for testing and demos, like a DDS-CAN BUS tunnel.
- Teaching my coworkers about the technologies and protocols.
- Centos scripts to automate main software and tests compilation.
- Helping in the project management with the Schedule and how to distribute the tasks.
- Learn basic Rhapsody from IBM in order to work with UML models.
- Verify that our system follows all standards and is “GVA compliant”.
- Design a configurable Excel that allows to configure each param of the system just using Excel.
- Design different subsystems inside HUMS as Alarms or Thresholds.

### DRAD
The objective of the project was to develop a SoC system for data analis ys at CERN. Given some electronic devices (similar to a camera matrix) that detects particles , the system (DRAD) should be able to use the detectors, analice all the data and send it outside. The system was mainly formed by a Linux Computer and FPGA integrated.

My roles here:
- Update and verify a previous thesis.
- Create some integration test for the drivers using VHDL.
- Fix and update the AXI4 architecture.
- Migrate from a RPC architecture to a web server architecture and C++ codes to
Python in order to have a more modern architecture (easier to use and scale).
- Desing a power-board, print it, weld all the components and test it.
- Configure a Raspberry Pi for using all the systems remotly (including the powerboard).

### IOT
Using Texas Instruments microcontrolers some IoT applications were developed. The main objective was to create systems that measure the environment and send the information to a server. These systems can be easily adapted to different needs.

Scope of work/Tasks:
- Develop drivers in C for microcontrollers as UART, I2C, Temperature Sensor, Memory.
- Designing unit-test system for those drivers.
- Create a repository-based architecture in IAR for reusing all drivers in diferent
projects and not have to copy-paste the code one by one.
- Support in some FreeRTos architectures.
