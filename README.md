IN PROGRESS!!
# WHO I AM ?
My name is Álvaro Morales. I was born in Alcalá de Guadaíra (Seville, Spain), and since I was a child, I showed a talent for logic and mathematics. I am a Chess Hooligan who also play videogames sometimes. As you can deduce, I speak English and Spanish. Futhermore, I'm learning French.

I also declare myself as a  ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)  fan and the tasty food is my passion.
